    <p> Girls face unique difficulties when they stay out of school. Most of them they are recruited into child labor or doing the only household work. They face exploitation, and many are subject to early marriages. As they grow, most of them become single mothers.</p>
    
    <p>Education can help change all of that. With more education for girls and young women, we reduce poverty by giving them the educational tools to fight poverty. For example, girls and women can earn higher wages, build their families, and better the communities they live in.</p>
    
    <p>Importantly, educated women are more likely to educate their children, passing this knowledge down to future generations, improving livelihoods and reducing extreme hunger and poverty in remote communities.</p>
